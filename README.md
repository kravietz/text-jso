# text-jso

This is a text dump of Mario Heiderich's [HTML5 Security Cheatsheet](http://heideri.ch/jso/) into a text file that can be used directly in penetration testing tools such as BurpSuite. To produce an up-to-date text dump just save the _jso.html_ locally and open it in a browser and you will see a long, plain-text list of XSS vectors, which you can then save into a _jso.txt_ file.
